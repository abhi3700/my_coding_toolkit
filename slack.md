# Slack

Used as communication tool for the team.

## My Slack

- Save any message as a reminder.
- Save any message as a task to <kbd>Later</kbd>
- Create private/public group based on the requirement.
- Sometimes for few people, don't need to create group if there is no frequent communication needed. Then add them as "Direct Message" and start the conversation.
- Create a channel for the team and add all the team members to the channel.
- Star the favorite channels, DMs.
- In channel, pin the docs, links, etc. which are frequently used at the top.
- Use `@channel` to notify all the members of the channel.
- Connections: Connect with people who are outside the organization. Need to be added first into Slack by admin.
