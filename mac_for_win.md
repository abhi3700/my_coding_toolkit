### Commands
* `$ open .`: open the Finder in the directory
* Run `.sh` file: `sh /path/to/file/with/extension`
* `$ which <command>`: gives the location of the command file

### PATH
* Stored in `/etc/profile`
* Add current directory to the PATH:
  - Open the file in ST editor, `$ subl ~/.zprofile`.
  - add this line `export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH` to the End of File (EOF). If a specific directory, then `export PATH=<custom-directory>:$PATH` e.g. `export PATH="/Users/abhi3700/Desktop/solana-1.8.5/bin:$PATH"`
  - Run this to activate `$ source ~/.zprofile`
  - Now, use the command in the current/new terminal. 

### Beautify
#### 1. Preparation
Recommend to install homebrew first:

`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Install zsh if you are on macOS version prior to Catalina:

* Install zsh `brew install zsh`
* Set zsh as your default shell `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh`

#### 2. Install oh-my-zsh
* `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`

#### 3. Install oh-my-zsh theme & must-have plugins
* config `.zshrc` (present in `~` location)
* open via `nano ~/.zshrc` & set these
* Set `ZSH_THEME` to your favorite theme name (preferred `intheloop`). Select from [link1](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes), [link2](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/External-themes)
* must-have plugins
```
plugins=(
  git
  extract
  autojump
  zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
)
```

## How-to
* [Force Shutdown using Key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePhnDneb19M)
* Hibernate: Go to Apple icon >> Shutdown >> tick the "Reopen the windows..." >> Press shutdown button. 

## Troubleshoot
### 1. Error: 'This Apple ID has not yet been used with the App Store'
* This error occurs after login into "App Store" >> press Review button >> Error >> Again login >> Review >> Error .....likewise infinite times. 
* __Solution__: Open "Apple Music" App. Go to Account on the top >> Login using Apple ID >> Set the payment (as None or other method) & billing address >> Done.

### 2. Unable to run unverified App
1. Open __Finder__
1. Search for the App
1. Select and `ctrl+click (on touchpad)` >> open
1. Thereafter, it's added into the list of unverified Apps & it will automatically open just like other verified Apps.

### 3. Unable to use Software requiring x86_64 architecture on M1 Macbook
* Below is the error for `eosio` installation
```
eosio: The intel architecture is required for this software.
Error: An unsatisifed requirement failed this build.
```
* Solution: Follow [this](https://benobi.one/posts/running_brew_on_m1_for_x86/)
  - Install Rosetta (this will fail if your Terminal is set to â€œOpen using Rosetta") by running: `softwareupdate --install-rose`
  - Run this command to install the Intel architecture Homebrew: `arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`
  - Add this to your ZSH config (I recommend using OhMyZSH + add a file called `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/brew.zsh`) with the contents:
     + `touch ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/brew.zsh`
  - `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"`
  - `alias ibrew='arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew'`
  - Re-source your zsh term `source ~/.zshrc`
  - Run Intel brew as `ibrew install <whatever>`

### 4. Error: xcrun: error: invalid active developer path
* Reason: After updating MacOS, the CLI needs to be updated.
* Solution: Run `xcode-select --install` in terminal.

### 5. The command is not activated even after `export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH`
* Reason: the command is not mentioned into the `~/.zprofile`
* Solution:
  - Open the file in ST editor, `$ subl ~/.zprofile`.
  - add this line `export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH` to the End of File (EOF).
  - Run this to activate `$ source ~/.zprofile`
  - Now, use the command in the current/new terminal.
