# MacOS for Windows users

```console
‚ùØ sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string
Apple M1 Max
```

---

Whether Hypervisor.framework is supported

```console
‚ùØ sysctl kern.hv_support
kern.hv_support: 1
```

> If it is 1, then your CPU is supported.
> If it is 0, it means the Hypervisor.framework cannot be used with your CPU, for a reason or another.

```console
‚ùØ sysctl -a | grep -o VMX                                                     ‚èé
VMX
```

## Installation

System:

```

Processor: ARM/M1

```

### Migrate

- In order to migrate the data from old Macbook, just open "Migration Assistant" App on the 'To Macbook' & share all the OTP details with 'From Macbook'.
- Ensure "Xcode" App from Appstore. This is very useful for development.

### New Account

1. Like in case of windows, format C:\ drive (containing OS) & then install from scratch. Here, just create a new account (also give admin rights) from the existing (Admin) account,
2. And then switch to the new account created & delete the previous admin account.

## Package Manager

Select [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installing libs, packages, tools on macOS.

> This is like `apt` (frequently used for Linux).

## Console

Prefer `zsh` instead of `bash`.

> Correspondingly, use `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zprofile` instead of `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile` file.

Use `profile` suffixed file for adding additional command during toolkit installation.

To know which one is being used now:

```

‚ùØ echo $0
-zsh

```

## Architecture

> An Apple Silicon mac can run both the **Intel** and the **ARM64** portions of a universal binary application. But not the other way around. Intel binaries are emulated under **Rosetta 2** on Apple Silicon, but there is no emulation of **ARM64** on **Intel**-based mac. [Source](https://indiespark.top/programming/compile-open-ssl-apple-silicon/)
>
> The long-rumored ARM Mac is on the horizon. With this comes the big work of porting and re-compiling current applications. But many Mac App Store apps are dependent on **OpenSSL**, which doesn‚Äôt yet support **ARM** on the Mac. Here is how you can continue to test your mac app while waiting for official **OpenSSL** support for the new hardware.

> For installation of `openssl` (imp. for most Apps) in Mac M1 machine, follow [this](https://indiespark.top/programming/compile-open-ssl-apple-silicon/) guide.

There are 2 methods to use x86_64 architecture on Mac M1:

1. VMs like UTM, Parallels
2. Switch from one arch to another in terminal

### 1. Virtual Machines/Emulator

### 2. How to switch the Terminal between x86_64 and arm64

- Switch from one architecture to another in this way:

```console
‚ùØ arch
arm64

‚ùØ arm

‚ùØ arch
arm64

‚ùØ intel

‚ùØ arch
i386
```

- Here, intel, arm is an alias which has been added in `~/.zshrc` file like this:

```
# switch to architectures - intel or m1
alias arm="env /usr/bin/arch -arm64 /bin/zsh --login"
alias intel="env /usr/bin/arch -x86_64 /bin/zsh --login"
```

- The command for switching to an architecture in Mac M1 is this: `$ env /usr/bin/arch -<architecture> /bin/zsh --login`

- We can also dedicate Refer this [error](https://github.com/abhi3700/my_coding_toolkit/blob/master/mac_for_win.md#3-unable-to-use-software-requiring-x86_64-architecture-on-m1-macbook) faced during one of the software installation

  - Run this to activate `$ source ~/.zprofile`
  - Now, use the command in the current/new terminal.

### Beautify

#### 1. Preparation

Recommend to install homebrew first:

`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Install zsh if you are on macOS version prior to Catalina:

- Install zsh `brew install zsh`
- Set zsh as your default shell `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh`

#### 2. Install oh-my-zsh

- `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`

#### 3. Install oh-my-zsh theme & must-have plugins

- config `.zshrc` (present in `~` location)
- open via `nano ~/.zshrc` & set these
- Set `ZSH_THEME` to your favorite theme name (preferred `intheloop`). Select from [link1](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes), [link2](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/External-themes)
- must-have plugins

```
plugins=(
  git
  extract
  autojump
  zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
)
```

## How-to

- [Force Shutdown using Key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePhnDneb19M)
- Hibernate: Go to Apple icon >> Shutdown >> tick the "Reopen the windows..." >> Press shutdown button.

## Troubleshoot

### 1. Error: 'This Apple ID has not yet been used with the App Store'

- This error occurs after login into "App Store" >> press Review button >> Error >> Again login >> Review >> Error .....likewise infinite times.
- **Solution**: Open "Apple Music" App. Go to Account on the top >> Login using Apple ID >> Set the payment (as None or other method) & billing address >> Done.

### 2. Unable to run unverified App

1. Open **Finder**
1. Search for the App
1. Select and `ctrl+click (on touchpad)` >> open
1. Thereafter, it's added into the list of unverified Apps & it will automatically open just like other verified Apps.

### 3. Unable to use Software requiring x86_64 architecture on M1 Macbook

- Below is the error for `eosio` installation

```
eosio: The intel architecture is required for this software.
Error: An unsatisifed requirement failed this build.
```

- Solution: Follow [this](https://benobi.one/posts/running_brew_on_m1_for_x86/)
  - Install Rosetta (this will fail if your Terminal is set to ‚ÄúOpen using Rosetta") by running: `$ softwareupdate --install-rose`
  - Run this command to install the Intel architecture Homebrew: `$ arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`
  - Add this to your ZSH config (I recommend using OhMyZSH + add a file called `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/brew.zsh`) with the contents:
    - create `.../brew.zsh` using `$ touch ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/brew.zsh`
  ```
  export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
  alias ibrew='arch -x86_64 /usr/local/bin/brew'
  ```
  - Re-source your zsh term `$ source ~/.zshrc`
  - Run Intel brew as `$ ibrew install <whatever>`
  - Now, create a new terminal by following these: [Source](https://medium.com/swlh/run-x86-terminal-apps-like-homebrew-on-your-new-m1-mac-73bdc9b0f343)
    - Open Finder and navigate to `Applications -> Utilities`
    - Right-click on the `Terminal` app and choose `Duplicate`
    - Rename your newly duplicated Terminal app something special like `Terminal-Rosetta`
    - Right-click the `Terminal-Rosetta` app and click on `Get Info`
    - Select the option to `Open using Rosetta`
    - You can now use `Terminal-Rosetta` to install and run Homebrew and any other x86 command-line apps just as you did back in the day üëè

### 4. Error: xcrun: error: invalid active developer path

- Reason: After updating MacOS, the CLI needs to be updated.
- Solution: Run `xcode-select --install` in terminal.

### 5. The command is not activated even after `export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH`

- Reason: the command is not mentioned into the `~/.zprofile`
- Solution:
  - Open the file in ST editor, `$ subl ~/.zprofile`.
  - add this line `export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH` to the End of File (EOF).
  - Run this to activate `$ source ~/.zprofile`
  - Now, use the command in the current/new terminal.

### 6. Git install repeatedly fails after Mac Update

- Reason: Unknown
- Solution: `$ sudo xcode-select -switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`
