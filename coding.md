# Coding

## Description

This is about my preferred coding style which I learnt over the years. And still learning.

## Variable naming style

- `camelCase`: JS, TS, Solidity.
- `snake_case`: Rust, C/C++.
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`: used for defining constants in C/C++, Rust, Solidity, Python.

## Repositories

Use github for quick project kickstart.

There are many boilerplates I have in my account for easy project kickstart.

For any type of learning, I create a repo with name like "My_Learning_Blockchain". And for languages, I use "My_Learning-Rust".
