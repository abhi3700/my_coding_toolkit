* ### UNC
  What is a UNC path?

  Short for Universal Naming Convention or Uniform Naming Convention, it is a PC format for specifying the location of resources on a local-area network (LAN). UNC uses the following format: <br/>
  `\\server-name\shared-resource-pathname` <br/>
  So, for example, to access the file test.txt in the directory EXAMPLES on the shared server SILO, you would write:<br/>
  `\\SILO\EXAMPLES\test.txt`
